# SOR4 Blender

This app lets you randomize various in-game properties in
Streets of Rage 4 in real-time by manipulating your stars,
gravity, health, speed, character size, selected move set, and
your lives! (SOR4 only! Not your actual lives!) This app only
works for the Steam version of the game as far as I know and
is known to work only on the v7 patch of the game (v07-s r13648)
released in December 13/14, 2021.


## Usage
Run game, run Blender! That simple! It doesn't matter if you
launch the game or the Blender first. Just have the game open
before you start the Blender! Toggle the properties you like
or don't like!
